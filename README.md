# Bi-LstmPG: Bi-Lstm Neural Network for Paraphrase Generation
Encoder-Decoder For Paraphrase Generation This work is supported by the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research in Algeria (Project C00L07UN100120180002)

Conception & Supervision : L. Ouahrani & D. Bennouar / Contributors : O. Hamel & S. Lamari

This code is used to train a Bi LSTM neural network with pre-trained word embedding allowing the generation 
of paraphrases.

For proper functionality of the code, Please do not delete any of the files associated with the code.

1 - to run this code you must install all the libraries used in the code.

2 - you must use a GPU to speed up the training phase.

3 - please leave 20% of the dataset aside for testing.

4 - this code records a checkpoint after each epoch to keep track of the last point.

5 - please use the code in 'BiLSTM generate paraphrases.ipynb' to test your generated paraphrases.

6 - please respect the order of the code cells during execution.

The resources needed for the training process are available here:
